            <h2>Executive Report</h2>
            <p>This report provides the results for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) National Cybersecurity Assessments and Technical Services- (Vulnerability Management) led Continuous Phishing Campaign Assessment (CON-PCA) for [ FULL CUSTOMER NAME. The CON-PCA is a practical exercise intended to support and measure the effectiveness of security awareness training for information system users. The results of this CON-PCA show the susceptibility of [ SHORT CUSTOMER NAME ] personnel to social engineering attacks—specifically email phishing attacks—in which an adversary tricks an email user into clicking a malicious link to gain unauthorized network access. In the scenario that this CON-PCA tested, the phishing attack bypassed technical controls that would normally detect and/or block malicious emails and links. The CON-PCA, therefore, measured [ SHORT CUSTOMER NAME ]’s level of vulnerability to a successful phishing attack by targeted user click rates, click times, response rates, and response times, as shown in Table 1.<br/><br/>

            This report aims to enhance EXAMPLE’s understanding of their information system users’ cybersecurity behavior and to promote a more secure and resilient workforce.</p>

            <p>Vulnerability Management has provided this CON-PCA to [COMPANY SHORTNAME] at no cost and coordinated all activities—including planning and testing–with [COMPANY SHORTNAME]’s point of contact. [COMPANY SHORTNAME] maintained control over the testing, including providing target email addresses, approving phishing email templates, approving testing timeframes, and adjusting mail security setting to ensure inbox access. This CON-PCA was not intended to, and did not, test technical controls or electronic protections designed to block phishing attempts. This CON-PCA spanned a six-week period and aimed to capture behavior-based metrics of [COMPANY SHORTNAME] information system users’ reaction to phishing emails of multiple complexity levels.</p>

            <p>The remainder of this report provides findings and metrics of the VM phishing service for EXAMPLE.</p>

            <h2>Example Methodology Specifics</h2>
            <p>VM used the methodology documented in Appendix A: Methodology to perform testing EXAMPLE. Specific phishing templates can be reviewed in Appendix C: Templates with corresponding complexity calculations. VM divided the 1000 email addresses that EXAMPLE provided into three groups. Group 1 had 333 addresses and received levels 1 and 4. Group 2 had 333 addresses and received levels 2 and 5. Group 3 had 334 addresses and received levels 3 and 6. See Table 3 for descriptions of email levels 1 – 6.</p>
            <p>The assessment’s goal was to capture the behavior-based responses of EXAMPLE to email phishing attempts; and the assessment operated under the scenario that no technical controls were able to detect, report, or stop the email phishing attempts. VM, as an external body conducting this PCA, did not have direct knowledge whether or not emails successfully arrived in targeted EXAMPLE user inboxes. To allow for a clear determination of click rates (email links clicked divided by emails sent), EXAMPLE or VM performed the following:</p>

            <h2>Summary of Testing Activities and Results</h2>
            <p>This PCA concentrated on how phishing email complexity affected EXAMPLE user click behavior and response behavior. VM expects that a more complex and deceptive phishing email has a higher likelihood of being clicked and a lower likelihood of being reported. This assessment also gathered organizational emails through open-source intelligence techniques to determine EXAMPLE’s potentially attackable online presence. See Appendix B: Detailed Results for detailed phishing and customer email data and Appendix C: Templates for a detailed explanation on complexity levels.</p>
            <p>Over six weeks, EXAMPLE’s targeted users received at least two phishing emails of increasing complexity. Levels 1 – 3 were “easier to detect” and levels 4 – 6 were “more difficult to detect,” based on the number and type of indicators used. The table below summarizes the phishing templates used in this PCA.</p>

            <h3>Click Rate vs. Report Rate</h3>
            <p>One of the most common measures of an organization’s susceptibility to phishing attacks is targeted-user click rates. If an actual phishing attack is able to bypass technical controls and arrive in a user’s inbox, the human target must agree to click on the malicious link or attachment for the attack to be successful. In practical exercises such as this PCA, targeted-user click rates will fluctuate depending on the email complexity used in testing. Effective security awareness training, however, should result in a noticeable click rate decrease over time and to a level deemed acceptable based on the organization’s risk management posture.</p>

            <p>The counterpart to user click rates is the user-reporting rate, determined by the number of emails sent or calls to alert EXAMPLE’s helpdesk during each campaign. Based on previous testing, VM recommends that organizations aim to have two people reporting the phishing attempts for every person that clicks. This ratio ensures that there is not only reporting coverage for the person clicking, but also redundant coverage in case the person who clicks the link does not report or does not realize they have been phished. Effective security awareness training should result in a noticeable report rate increase over time and to a level deemed acceptable based on the organization’s risk management posture.</p>

            <p>In this report, the percentages shown by the user click rate and user report rate represent, respectively, the percentage of targeted people (determined by a unique email address) who have clicked at least once on a “malicious” link and those who reported a suspicious email. The number of unique clicks correlates to the number of end user devices potentially compromised in each campaign. The number of user reports correlates to the number of opportunities the EXAMPLE security team had to identify a potential breach and reduce its impact. Table 4 and Figure 1 summarize click and report rates.</p><br/>

            <h2>Click Time vs. Report Time</h2>
            <p>To contain an attack, an organization’s security team must be aware of the potential breach. In the scenario that this PCA tested, no technical controls were triggered during a phishing attack and the clock for a potential breach started once a targeted user clicked on a “malicious” link. Timely user reporting decreases the window of opportunity that an adversary has to access data or gain further network entry. Timely reporting also increases the opportunity the security team has to detect and respond to a potential breach. By educating users on how to both spot and promptly respond to phishing attempts, an organization can improve their anti-phishing defenses.</p>
            <p>The following table details the time to first click and first report throughout the assessment and the lead or lag times for incident response measures to be activated(time elapsed represented in hours:minutes:seconds).</p>

            <p>For this PCA, VM looked for EXAMPLE email addresses publicly available online. The following email addresses were discovered through passive reconnaissance and collected using open-source information gathering tools. The emails VM discovered were not used in this engagement unless previously provided by the technical POC. See Appendix B: Detailed Results for a complete enumeration of discovered emails.</p>

            </table>

            <p>Based on previous testing, most of email addresses discovered during passive reconnaissance are sourced from organizational documents and presentations shared online. To limit the exposure of exploitable organizational information, VM recommends that employee names and emails be limited in use on websites and in reports or presentations stored on the public Internet. When announcing new products or updating online registrations, VM also recommends that organizations use generic distribution email address as opposed to specific employee names.</p>
