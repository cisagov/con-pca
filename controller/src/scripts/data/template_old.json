All departments and bureaus within the Federal Government are being directed to draft a plan to help meet project budget shortages and find ways to reduce spending over the coming fiscal year.\n\nWe have been asked to work more efficiently with less. As a result, many budgets and programs are facing significant reduction. The AGENCY Executive Office has developed a draft plan that will address any potential budget shortcomings.\n\nTo learn more about the budget and how your program maybe affected, we have put together an informational page available here <LINK>.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please send replies to <embedded link>.\n[Organization Signature]\n"
