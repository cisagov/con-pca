Many people don\u2019t realize how eazy it is to save paper by going paperless or consurving paper. One beautiful living tree makes approximately 100 sheets of paper. So please don\u2019t waste paper! Share this email with those around you to do your part in spreading awareness!\n\nPlease help this mission by visiting our website and allying youreself with us by supporting our cause. <LINK>\n\nThank you for making a difference in your office,\n\nTom\nPresident of OPD\n",
