# this module should
# determine how many templates are necessary 
# for the subscription
# allocate each of the emails targets to that subscription
# return the list of targets with their email

# first take the list of targets and the list of low, moderate, and high
# next determine how many templates we should have
# max templates gets the number of templates in the system
# then if template usage is conservative burn,
#    max templates is the less of 15 or #of targets divided by 3# 
# if template usage is balanced max templates is of targets divided by 3
# if template using is hardest to detect then utilize all templates. 
# however there cannot be more templates than targets
# so max templates = # of targets

# first get the number of targets total
# run the template determination to get the rough number of templates required
# retreive the set number
